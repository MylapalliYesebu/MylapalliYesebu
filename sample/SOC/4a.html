<!-- 
DESCRIPTION: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In 
JavaScript, there are several types of functions, including: 
Named Functions: These functions are defined using the function keyword, followed by the 
function name, and a pair of parentheses. They can be invoked by calling their name. 
Anonymous Functions: These functions are defined without a name, and are often used as 
callbacks or event listeners. 
Arrow Functions: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are a shorthand way of writing 
anonymous functions. 
Function Parameters: Functions can accept one or more parameters, which act as inputs to 
the function. 
Nested Functions: Functions can be defined inside other functions, creating a hierarchy of 
functions. 
Built-in Functions: JavaScript comes with several built-in functions, such as parseInt(), 
parseFloat(), and Math.random(). 
Variable Scope in Functions: Variables declared inside a function have local scope, and are 
not accessible outside of the function. Variables declared outside of a function have global 
scope, and can be accessed anywhere in the code. 
To declare a function in JavaScript, use the function keyword, followed by the function 
name, and a pair of parentheses. The code inside the function is enclosed in curly braces. To 
invoke the function, simply call its name, optionally passing in any required parameters. -->
