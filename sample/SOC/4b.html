DESCRIPTION: Working with classes in JavaScript involves creating and using objects 
that have a defined set of properties and behaviors. Classes are used to define the structure 
and behavior of objects, and can be created and instantiated using the class keyword. Classes 
in JavaScript can also inherit properties and methods from other classes, which is known as 
inheritance. Inheritance allows classes to reuse code and build on existing functionality, 
which can lead to more efficient and organized code. To create a class, the class keyword is 
used, followed by the name of the class and a set of curly braces. Properties and methods are 
defined within the class using constructor functions and prototype methods. To inherit from a 
class, the extends keyword is used to specify the class being inherited from. Inherited 
properties and methods can be accessed using the super keyword -->
